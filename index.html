<h2>
Rules</h2>
<p>
    <i>ALL server messages are logged for the purpose of preventing abuse and misuse of the server. Please do not join if you do not agree. Please contact a moderator if you wish to have messages removed from the server logs immediately.</i><br/>
The following rules are guidelines for the staff and members to follow. The staff moderate in the understanding that you have read the rules as instructed in your welcome ping upon joining the discord. The rules may contain loopholes or inaccuracies, if you think something might not be allowed then feel free to ask first. The staff team reserves the right to hand out punishments based on a situation that may not be covered directly by the rules. Please use common sense.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>
Rules (click to expand!):</b>
<br/>

<br/>
NSFW
<br/>
</p>
<button class="accordion">No NSFW Content</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>This includes anything containing nudity, intense sexuality, violence, gore and/or other potentially disturbing subject matter, which the viewer may not wish to be seen looking at while in a formal environment, such as work or school. If you’re not sure, then approach a member of staff to clarify before posting. Continued posting will result in a warn and eventually a ban.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">No loli/shota or loli/shotaesque</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Even if the pic itself is an innocent pic of a character from loli - underage girls or guys depicted in any way that can be interpreted as sexual/NSFW are not allowed. Posting will result in an instant ban.</p>
</div>

<p>
<br/>
Offensive or Harmful Content
<br/>
</p>
<button class="accordion">No encouraging - or memes that encourage - suicide or self-harm</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>This includes memes that glorify death, and/or describe death as a release, as well as "joke" "KYS" comments. These will be removed by a moderator and you will get a warn or ban.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">No harassment or offensive content, especially based on religion, sex, ethnicity, political leaning or physical appearance</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Consider this server to be the same as a casual group therapy. If it wouldn’t be acceptable in group therapy, it wouldn’t be acceptable here. ie, racism, homophobia, transphobia, body shaming, instigating arguments for the sake of arguing, ban baiting the mods etc.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">No incel-like views</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Saying ‘I want a girlfriend but I can’t find anyone I like’ is fine, devolving into insulting women because they won’t date you is not. This includes generalisations. Continuing when asked to stop will result in a mute or ban, depending on the severity.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">No doxxing or impersonation, even with the other person's permission</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Doxxing will get you instantly banned and your account reported to Discord. Impersonating another member by changing your name/nickname to represent them could get the other person in trouble for your actions. A moderator will change your name and PM you to ask you to not do it again. Doing it again after this will result in a warn.</p>
</div>

<p>
        <br/>
        Personal Views and Advertising
        <br/>
        </p>

<button class="accordion">No advertising for monetary gain or other external links</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>If you wish to advertise anything else, clear it with a member of staff first or it will be removed. Continued spamming will result in a mute or ban. No external invite links.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">No "miracle solution" personal views</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>No encouraging drug/alcohol use, or recommending nofap or other ‘miracle anxiety solving’ methods, subreddits or websites. No suggesting someone stop their medication without consulting their doctor.
        This includes mixing drugs/alcohol with prescribed medications, or other anecdotal ‘research’ that isn’t peer reviewed by the medical community. This discord acts upon the basis that your doctor knows more about the medication they’re prescribing than you do. If you aren’t satisfied, then seek a second opinion from another licensed medical practitioner. Keep in mind social outings that involve alcohol isn’t considered encouraging alcohol usage as long as the main focus is on socialisation. Repeated shilling of snakeoil will get you banned.</p>
</div>


<p>
        <br/>
        Meta
        <br/>
        </p>

        <button class="accordion">Do not harass any member of staff due to someone being banned. Do not campaign for someone to be unbanned.</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>Campaigning to have someone unbanned, ie putting #unban[user] in your nickname, will result in your name being changed by a moderator and being asked not to do it again. Constantly bringing it up in chat will result in a warn. Repeatedly breaking this rule will result in a ban.</p>
            </div>


        <button class="accordion">Please do not contribute to rule-breaking. Report any rule violations to a member of staff.</button>
        <div class="panel">
<p>If you’re in a situation where people are starting to break the rules please stop typing and let the mods deal with it</p>
        </div>       
        
        <button class="accordion">No self-bots or user-bots</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>"SELF-BOTS" / "USER-BOTS" are NOT permitted. If you wish for a bot to be added, please ask in #server-meta. Proof of accounts running automatically or being used in a bot-like way will result in that account and all other(s) (if the user also has a main account) related being banned.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What is a warning?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Moderators and admins can assign warnings to users. These are like notes attached to the user that only moderators and admins can read. They help us make decisions in the future if you have continually broken rules before. If you are warned, you will receive a private message from a bot explaining why.</p></div>
